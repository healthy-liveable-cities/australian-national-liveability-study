# 1. Overall project structure

The region-specific liveability index files and documentation will lie within a project directory (say, 'D:/vic_metrourban_li').

Within this project directory are the folders:

admin
data
process


The 'admin' folder contains the project documentation (meeting notes, literature searches, etc)

The 'data' folder contains raw and derived data sources, as well as the project intermediary data files and back up of current SQL database.  The current document concerns the structure of this directory.

The 'process' folder contains the scripts required to create the project database and index

# 2. Data folder structure

The 'data' folder for the should contain the following folders and subfolders:

ABS
  -- derived  <<< files modified for processing from download state (e.g. projected into GDA2020, or removal of table footers in csv files)
  -- downloads <<< Either the source files or records of how these were sourced, prior to cleaning.
  -- TableBuilder custom groups <<< group template files to facilitate export of ABS data using the ABS Table Builder
POS              <<< store cleaned public open space data here, with notes on processing
roads            <<< store source network here, with notes on processing
address_points   <<< store address points (e.g. G-NAF 2018 points), with notes on any processing

Destinations.gdb  <<< ??? or seperate destination folders?
