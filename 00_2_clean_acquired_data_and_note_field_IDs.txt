# Checklist

- Keep a provenance.txt file noting all data sources in the same folder where they are stored

- If there are multiple resources in a folder, this file will contain information on all resources

- Retain original data sources, or make a note of where these are located and can be accessed offline in the provenance file

- If data sources are modified, make clear but detailed notes of any processing and who did this so this can be replicated if required
