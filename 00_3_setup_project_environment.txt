This project assumes the following:

You have set things up for GDA2020 use as per the pdf file:
./ntnl_li_2018_template/admin/Updating software for GDA2020.pdf

The above file covers the following
     You have postgresql installed w/ PostGIS extension (version 2.4, at time of writing).
       -- Get from: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads
       -- Scripts were written with PostgreSQL 9.6.1, so recommend using this version
       
     You have ArcGIS 10.6 installed
     
     You have Python 2.7 installed.  
       -- Specifically, use the 64-bit version with ArcGIS 10.6.x
             
     Install psycopg2 (the python library facilitating connection with PostgreSQL) into the ArcGIS 64-bit Python 2.7 installation
      -- open a console window to C:\Python27\ArcGISx6410.6\Scripts
      -- type: pip install psycopg2
      -- change directory to C:\Python27\ArcGISx6410.6
      -- type: python
      -- type: import psycopg2
      -- if an error message appears, something has gone wrong. Ask Carl as there are some quick fixes if it doesn't work
      
      
     Install sqlalchemy (for more postgresql integration using python - e.g. pandas dataframe to_sql function)
       -- as per instructions for psycopg2, except 'pip install sqlalchemy'

Also, install config parser (allows use of our project specific config.ini file)
 -- open a console window to C:\Python27\ArcGISx6410.6\Scripts
 -- type: pip install ConfigParser
 -- change directory to C:\Python27\ArcGISx6410.6
 -- type: python
 -- type: import ConfigParser
 -- if an error message appears, something has gone wrong.

 
I recommend that you run the scripts from Notepad++ (npp).  To do this:
  -- install
  -- press F5 
  -- in shortcut location write: C:\Python27\ArcGISx6410.6\python.exe -i "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" 
  -- choose a shortcut like Ctrl Alt X
  -- Now, when I open a script in the process folder and press ctrl+alt+x this script will run with the correct python version and aware of relative paths from config file
 
 
Data sources should be pre-processed as GDA2020 GA LLC using the NTv2 transformation in ArcGIS or QGIS --- the latter may be more reliable (e.g. in ArcGIS the correct transformation options for some GDA94 projected files don't automatically  get identified, but in such cases I noticed they were in QGIS -- example is the trial 2018 Vic Open GNAF data from JA.

So --- tranform files to correct CRS first.
